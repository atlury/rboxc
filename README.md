# Rbox C2Rust port

The objective is one Rust multicall executable targeting the 554 command names
in the existing Rbox inventory. GNU-equivalent commands come first. Programs
without a confirmed GNU provider are deferred. SELinux and systemd remain
excluded by operator direction.

This is a separate project in `/root/rboxc`. The original `/root/rbox` and its
uncommitted work are preserved. The previous safe-no_std-first objective has
been superseded by the user's 2026-09-06 instruction. The external goal tracker
still holds that old objective paused: its API rejected replacement of an
unfinished goal and exposes no cancellation operation. This document records
the operative new objective without falsely declaring the old work complete.

## Acceptance criteria

1. Translate pinned authoritative GNU sources with pinned C2Rust.
2. Compile and link command implementations into one executable, supporting
   both `rboxc COMMAND ...` and command-name symlinks.
3. Compare behavior with the matching GNU executables and run their original
   test suites. Preserve raw results and account for every failure and skip.
4. Run Valgrind on applicable command behavior and failure paths. Record actual
   memory/descriptor findings, including retained runtime allocations.
5. Commit source-sized increments. Keep translated, compiling, tested, and
   complete states separate; an inventory entry is not a completion claim.

Rust `std`, unsafe Rust, libc, and GNU C helper libraries are permitted for this
behavior-first phase. Safe ownership conversion and no_std are later work.
An external GNU executable used as an oracle is never counted as a port.

## Initial source profile

- GNU Coreutils 9.11 is the first provider. Its own single-binary build rules
  supply the command-specific entry names and symbol namespace.
- C2Rust revision `e1e5bf257863107c54e9f42b345c2aeccd925458` is pinned. The
  released 0.22.1 failed on generic selections in the current GNU/glibc headers;
  the pinned revision translated the trial successfully.
- The initial platform is Linux x86-64 with glibc 2.43 and Clang 21.1.8.
  C2Rust is built with Rust 1.93.0; the generated executable uses pinned
  `nightly-2026-01-22` for C variadic definitions.
- GNU's compiler configuration is retained for the C oracle/helper build.
  Translation uses the documented GNU17 parser adaptation where needed.

`inventory/applets.json` records all 553 observed existing names, their proposed
GNU providers, and their current state. Rbox's `APPLET_COUNT` constant says 554,
but its actual dispatcher and full binary list agree on 553 distinct commands;
the one-name discrepancy remains recorded in `inventory/sources.json`.
Provider assignments outside the pinned
Coreutils set still require source/version confirmation before implementation.

## Status

The executable registers 107 Coreutils commands, with 105 active Rust command
entries. `numfmt` and `seq` temporarily retain C entries while their unsupported
floating conversions are adapted. `printf`, `sort`, and `od` now use Rust entries
with native numeric helpers: floating values stay inside GNU C functions and
cross the boundary only as bytes or text. This preserves the host's x87
`long double` representation without using C2Rust's incompatible IEEE binary128
ABI. See `evidence/translation.json` for per-command results and helper hashes.

GNU helper bodies remain native C. For example, `cp.c` is translated, while
`copy.c` and its data-copy helpers remain C. Every active Rust command's C entry
object is removed from the linked helper archives. This is a behavior-first
port in progress, not a claim that every implementation body is already Rust.

The initial release executable is 2,382,472 bytes (2.27 MiB), dynamically linked
on the recorded host profile. This does not include native shared-library
dependencies or command-specific runtime helpers such as GNU `stdbuf`'s library.
Cross-platform builds and release packaging remain open.

Recorded checks:

| Check | Result | Coverage limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GNU help/version comparisons | 428/428 pass | Both multicall and symlink entry forms |
| Valgrind help paths | 107/107 pass | Help only |
| Normal/error behavior fixtures | 148/148 match GNU | Streams, status, contents, modes, link topology |
| Valgrind normal/error fixtures | 148/148 clean | Bounded fixtures; retained allocations recorded separately |
| Original GNU cp tests | 89 pass, 13 prerequisite skips, 30 excluded | 66 scripts, root and ordinary-user profiles |
| cp mutation comparisons | 879 pass | Bounded local backup/removal/error fixtures |
| cp backup comparisons | 75 pass | Backup names and preserved fixture data |

Cleanup now releases `expr` results, `date` timezone/format storage,
non-following `tail` file records, and `tr` construct lists (including parse
failures). Selected original GNU tests pass: 22 `expr`, 56 `tr`, 54 `tac`, and 33 `pr`
cases, plus ten date/tail/cat/dd/split/sort/od/printf shell scripts. These selections are pinned in
`inventory/gnu-reviewed-tests.json`; they do not certify the whole suites.

`pr` now releases its filename list. `tac` frees the base of its working
buffer after all operands and closes its cached temporary stream after the
final use, including stdin reuse. The Rust `sort` entry releases its
independent argv-name vector on normal completion; its token-file ownership
path remains unchanged. Native source adaptations are separately hashed and
compiled into helper copies; the GNU oracle is preserved. All current
behavior/Valgrind fixtures pass, including bounded buffer growth and stdin.
This does not establish cleanliness for every option or failure path. The `env` fixture
now runs the pinned GNU `printenv`; its earlier host-child findings remain in
the previous committed evidence. Baseline equivalence does not count as Valgrind
cleanliness. A follow-up cleanup closes the directory descriptor owned by
`cp` after copying and restoring parent metadata, preserving GNU status and
errno. All 10 current `cp` behavior/Valgrind fixtures pass; the GNU baseline
still retains that descriptor. This does not certify every `cp` exit path.
Retained allocations and lost allocations are recorded separately. The test
runner returns failure when a selected fixture has an unresolved finding.

No command is certified complete. Full provider suites, missing prerequisites,
numerical C entry replacements, memory/descriptor cleanup, and other GNU
providers remain outstanding. Excluded original tests are listed with reasons
and source hashes in `inventory/gnu-cp-tests.json`; they are not counted as passes.
Build products and raw test logs stay outside Git; source, scripts, pins, and
result summaries are committed. `evidence/status.json` records the binary hash
and current results.

## Build and reproduce

The shared aligned-allocation adapter rounds backing sizes to alignment
multiples, checks rounding overflow, and gives zero-size requests distinct
allocations. Callers keep their original logical byte counts. `cat` and `split`
now release their owned buffers. The adapter passes 24 bounded allocation checks
and an overflow rejection check under Valgrind, with zero live heap.

The current host needs GCC, GNU Make, Python 3, binutils, Clang/LLVM 21 development
libraries, CMake, Rust 1.93.0 with rustfmt, the pinned nightly, and GNU Coreutils
9.11 source. Test dependencies include Valgrind 3.26, strace, Perl, and ordinary
GNU shell utilities. Optional filesystem/locale prerequisites produce recorded
skips. `inventory/sources.json` pins the GNU archive hash and C2Rust revision.
The default GNU source location is `/opt/src/coreutils-9.11`; set
`GNU_COREUTILS_SOURCE` consistently to use another location.

```

The C-entry opt-in is explicit: assembly without `--allow-c-entries` refuses an
incomplete translation. The two imported cp differential scripts currently use
the separately installed GNU oracle at `/opt/gnu/coreutils-9.11`; their environment
overrides are documented in the script variables.

Reproducible adaptations live in `scripts/postprocess.py` and the translation
driver: GNU17 parsing of current headers, opaque pointer declarations, pinned
Rust `va_list` and pointer APIs, and GNU's portable arithmetic fallback for
`factor`. C bridges preserve GNU's CPU-feature query and variadic formatting
helper. Build warnings concerning generated ABI declarations and pointer
comparisons remain visible; compilation is not a safety proof.

This repository has local incremental commits and no configured remote. The old
Rbox remote is not used as an implicit publication destination for this project.
